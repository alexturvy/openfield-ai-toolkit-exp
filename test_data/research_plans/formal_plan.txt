Research Plan: E-commerce Checkout Optimization Study

Background:
Our e-commerce platform has experienced a 35% cart abandonment rate over the past quarter, 
significantly higher than the industry average of 20%. Initial analytics suggest users are 
dropping off at various stages of the checkout process, but we lack qualitative insights 
into the underlying causes.

Research Goal:
To understand the factors contributing to high cart abandonment rates and identify 
actionable improvements to the checkout flow that will increase conversion rates.

Research Questions:
1. At which specific steps in the checkout process are users most likely to abandon their carts?
2. What are the primary pain points users experience during checkout?
3. How do trust and security concerns impact checkout completion?
4. What role does pricing transparency (shipping, taxes) play in abandonment decisions?
5. How do mobile vs. desktop experiences differ in terms of checkout friction?

Assumptions:
- Users abandon carts due to unexpected costs revealed late in the process
- The checkout flow requires too many steps or too much information
- Trust signals (security badges, payment options) are not prominently displayed
- Mobile checkout experience is significantly worse than desktop

Hypotheses:
H1: Displaying total costs (including shipping and taxes) earlier will reduce abandonment by 15%
H2: Reducing checkout steps from 5 to 3 will increase completion rates by 20%
H3: Adding trust signals and security badges will improve conversion for new users by 10%

Methodology:
1. Quantitative Analysis (Week 1):
   - Funnel analysis of 10,000 recent checkout sessions
   - Heatmap and click tracking on checkout pages
   - A/B test of simplified checkout flow with 5,000 users

2. Qualitative Research (Weeks 2-3):
   - 20 moderated usability testing sessions with checkout tasks
   - 15 user interviews focusing on abandoned cart experiences
   - 5 follow-up interviews with users who abandoned high-value carts

3. Synthesis and Recommendations (Week 4):
   - Cross-reference quantitative and qualitative findings
   - Prioritize improvements based on impact and effort
   - Create prototype designs for top 3 improvements

Success Metrics:
- Reduce cart abandonment rate from 35% to 25% within 3 months
- Increase checkout completion rate by 15%
- Improve checkout satisfaction score from 3.2 to 4.0 (out of 5)
- Decrease average time to complete checkout by 30%

Participant Criteria:
- Mix of new and returning customers
- Recent cart abandoners (within last 30 days)
- Diverse age groups (25-55) and tech proficiency levels
- Both mobile and desktop users
- Minimum cart value of $50

Timeline:
- Week 1: Quantitative analysis and A/B test setup
- Weeks 2-3: User interviews and usability testing
- Week 4: Analysis and recommendations
- Week 5: Stakeholder presentation and implementation planning
