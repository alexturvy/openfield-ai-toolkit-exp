# Quick Research Plan - Navigation Redesign

Hey team! ðŸ‘‹

So we've been getting a ton of complaints about our navigation being confusing. Support tickets are up 40% with people asking "where is X feature?" which is... not great.

## What we need to figure out

- Why can't people find what they're looking for?
- Is our menu structure totally off from what users expect?
- Are we using weird labels that don't make sense to normal humans?
- Should we add search? Better categories? Both?

## My hunches (could be wrong!)

I'm thinking:
- Our feature names are too technical/jargony
- We have too many menu levels (saw someone click 5 times to find billing!)
- Mobile navigation is probably a disaster (haven't even looked at it properly)

## How we'll do this

Let's keep it simple:

1. **Watch some session recordings** - I want to see people getting lost in real time
2. **Quick guerrilla testing** - Grab 10 people and ask them to find specific features
3. **Card sorting** - Figure out how users would organize our features
4. **Interviews** - Talk to 5-8 power users about their mental models

Should take about 2 weeks if we hustle.

## What success looks like

- Navigation-related support tickets drop by at least 50%
- Time to find key features decreases to under 10 seconds
- Users stop rage-quitting during onboarding

## Who we need to talk to

- Mix of new users (less than 1 month) and experienced users
- Different use cases (freelancers, agencies, enterprise)
- Include at least 3 mobile-primary users
- Bonus: someone who switched from a competitor

*Note: If this goes well, we should probably look at the whole IA, but let's start with navigation and see what we learn.*
