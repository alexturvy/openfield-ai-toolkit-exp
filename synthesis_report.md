## Research Context

### Background
Instructors often face the challenge of teaching neuroscience concepts to introductory psychology students who may lack a foundational understanding of biology and find the topic intimidating. Furthermore, many instructors teaching these courses are not neuroscience specialists themselves and struggle to make the material engaging. To address this, the "NeuroQuest" project aims to create an immersive, gaming-inspired suite of learning activities that moves beyond the static 3D models of competitors. The vision is a "quest through the brain" that helps students not just learn, but appreciate neuroscience through interactivity and approachability. The suite is planned to include four discrete, separately assignable activities: three that comprise the Neuron (structure, action potential, neural communication) and one larger activity on the Brain. The core philosophy is to shift from rote memorization to authentic, performance-based assessment where students apply concepts to relatable, real-world scenarios (e.g., the biological and emotional response to vaping). This research phase will test the initial concept with instructors from both Introductory Psychology and Brain and Behavior courses to validate the desirability of this approach and gather feedback to guide future development. ASSUMPTIONS An interactive, gaming-inspired approach will be more valuable to instructors and more engaging for students than traditional methods or more static 3D model-only methods. Assessment that allows students to meaningfully apply the concepts provides valuable differentiation against existing solutions. The current concepts and wireframes are a starting point that will be refined based on instructor feedback. Providing discrete, assignable activities offers valuable curriculum flexibility for instructors in different courses (e.g., Intro Psych, Brain & Behavior).

### Assumptions
- An interactive, gaming-inspired approach will be more valuable to instructors and more engaging for students than traditional methods or more static 3D model-only methods.
- Assessment that allows students to meaningfully apply the concepts provides valuable differentiation against existing solutions.
- The current concepts and wireframes are a starting point that will be refined based on instructor feedback.
- Providing discrete, assignable activities offers valuable curriculum flexibility for instructors in different courses (e.g., Intro Psych, Brain & Behavior).

### Research Goal
Our primary goal is to illuminate the path forward for the NeuroQuest project. We seek to understand how the core vision of an immersive, scenario-based neuroscience experience resonates with instructors, ensuring we honor the initial concept while gathering the insights needed to collaboratively shape its future development. Note: The moderator should redirect specific questions about content back to the participant to gauge importance (e.g., "How important is it that we cover that topic?"). Specifically, this research aims to: Uncover which elements of the plan most effectively communicate the project's unique value for increasing both student engagement and instructor confidence. Identify opportunities to refine the narrative journey and assessment model to best align with instructors' real-world teaching practices and course goals. Gather specific, actionable feedback that will empower the team to make informed decisions on development priorities, ensuring the final product brings their innovative vision to life.

2. What are your thoughts on the overall gaming-inspired approach to teaching this complex science?
3. We're exploring branding concepts like the name 'NeuroQuest' and calling students 'Neuronauts.' What's your reaction to this type of branding?
4. How valuable would a suite of activities like this be for your Introductory Psychology or Brain and Behavior course?
5. Does this prototype seem as though it addresses the needs of students to effectively understand and apply neuroscience concepts?
6. How valuable is that flexibility for your course?
7. Which of these components feel necessary for your course, and why?
8. How do you see these activities integrating into your current teaching practices (e.g., as a homework activity, in-class activity, exam replacement)?
9. How does this concept compare to the tools and resources you use now (e.g., 3D models, slides, physical models, videos, websites)?
10. How do you currently assess student performance on this material?
11. How effective do you think the 'build-then-apply' model shown would be as an assessment tool?

### Methodology
The research will involve interviews with higher education instructors during the week of 8/18/25, structured around a 60-minute flow that includes introductions, discussions of the full suite, core activities, and broader vision.
