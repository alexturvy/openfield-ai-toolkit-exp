# Research-Aware Analysis Implementation

## Overview

The Insight Synthesizer now includes comprehensive research-goal-directed analysis capabilities. This transforms the tool from generic theme-finding to targeted question-answering while maintaining semantic quality.

## Key Features

### 1. Research Goal Structure
The system accepts research goals in standard research brief format:
- **Background**: Context for the research
- **Assumptions**: What we believe/assume going in
- **Research Goal**: Overall objective
- **Research Questions**: Specific questions to answer

### 2. Research-Aware Processing
- **Hybrid Clustering**: 70% semantic similarity + 30% research relevance
- **Guided Synthesis**: LLM prompts include research context
- **Coverage Validation**: Tracks which questions are answered
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing coverage

### 3. Enhanced Output
Each theme in the report shows:
- Which research questions it addresses
- Research implications
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Actionable findings

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **ResearchGoal & ResearchGoalManager** (`research/goal_manager.py`)
   - Manages research questions and context
   - Calculates relevance scores using embeddings
   - Generates focused synthesis prompts

2. **ResearchAwareClusterer** (`analysis/research_clustering.py`)
   - Creates hybrid embeddings combining semantic and research relevance
   - Ensures clusters remain coherent while being research-focused
   - Rescues high-relevance content from noise

3. **ResearchCoverageValidator** (`validation/research_validator.py`)
   - Analyzes how well each question is addressed
   - Identifies gaps in coverage
   - Generates actionable recommendations

## Usage

### Interactive CLI
```bash
python synthesizer.py
# When prompted for research goals, provide:
# 1. Background
# 2. Assumptions 
# 3. Research Goal
# 4. Research Questions
```

### Programmatic
```python
from src.insight_synthesizer.pipeline import InsightSynthesizer
from src.insight_synthesizer.research.goal_manager import ResearchGoal

goals = ResearchGoal(
    background="Context about the research",
    assumptions=["Key assumptions"],
    research_goal="What we want to achieve",
    research_questions=["Q1?", "Q2?", "Q3?"]
)

synthesizer = InsightSynthesizer()
report = synthesizer.analyze_directory(
    "data/",
    lens="pain_points",
    research_goals=goals
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Focused Analysis**: Ensures specific research questions get answered
2. **Coverage Tracking**: Know which questions are well-addressed vs gaps
3. **Actionable Insights**: Get specific recommendations tied to questions
4. **Quality Maintenance**: Preserves semantic clustering quality
5. **Backward Compatible**: Works with or without research goals

## Technical Details

### Relevance Scoring
- Each text chunk gets a 0-1 relevance score
- Uses cosine similarity between chunk and question embeddings
- Cached for performance

### Hybrid Clustering
- Combines semantic embeddings with research relevance
- Configurable weights (default: 70/30 split)
- Post-processing rescues high-relevance outliers

### Coverage Metrics
- Tracks themes per question
- Confidence distribution (high/medium/low)
- Identifies question-type specific gaps (why/how/what)

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Complete**:
- Research goal data structures
- CLI integration  
- Research-aware clustering
- Coverage validation
- Enhanced reporting
- Commercial model support for faster testing

The system successfully guides analysis toward answering specific research questions while maintaining high-quality semantic analysis.
