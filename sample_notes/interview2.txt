Interviewer: Thanks for joining us today. How has your experience been with the system?

Dr. Stevens: From a clinical perspective, it's not meeting our needs. The workflow is completely backwards from how we actually work.

Interviewer: Can you elaborate on the workflow issues?

Dr. Stevens: We need quick access to patient records, but the system makes us go through three different screens just to get basic information. Every click costs time during consultations.

Interviewer: Are there any features that work well for you?

Dr. Stevens: The reporting feature is actually quite good once you figure out how to use it. But the learning curve is too steep.
