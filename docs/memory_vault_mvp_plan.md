# Memory Vault MVP Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Memory Vault MVP is a semantic search tool designed to work with the messy reality of research scattered across multiple Google Drives and client folders. Rather than requiring perfect organization upfront, it creates a "Research Lake" that grows organically as teams copy relevant research into a central location.

## Current Reality

- Research files scattered across multiple Google Drives (internal and client)
- No central repository or consistent organization
- Client work requires local copies for indexing
- Mix of file types: interviews, reports, notes, surveys
- Various stages of research: raw data → synthesis → final outputs

## MVP Approach: The Research Lake

### Core Concept

Create a simple local directory that serves as a "lake" where research flows in over time:

```
~/OpenFieldResearchLake/
├── ClientA_MobileApp/
│   ├── interviews/
│   ├── reports/
│   └── raw_notes/
├── ClientB_Ecommerce/
│   ├── user_research/
│   └── survey_results/
├── Internal_Projects/
│   ├── design_system_research/
│   └── methodology_docs/
├── _archived/
│   ├── 2023_projects/
│   └── 2022_projects/
└── .memory-vault/
    ├── index.faiss
    └── metadata.db
```

### Key Features for MVP

1. **Opportunistic Collection**
   - Copy files from various drives as needed
   - No "big bang" migration required
   - Research lake grows organically

2. **Simple Commands**
   ```bash
   # Index everything in the lake
   memory-vault index
   
   # Add and index new client folder
   memory-vault collect ~/Downloads/ClientC_research.zip --client ClientC
   
   # Search across everything
   memory-vault search "user frustration with onboarding"
   
   # Search within specific client
   memory-vault search "payment issues" --client ClientB
   ```

3. **Smart File Handling**
   - Auto-extract zip files
   - Detect document types
   - Basic organization (interviews/, reports/, etc.)
   - Duplicate detection

4. **Semantic Search That Works**
   - Natural language queries
   - Finds conceptually related content
   - Shows connections across projects
   - Highlights patterns over time

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (Week 1)

**Components:**
- File ingestion (txt, md, docx, pdf)
- FAISS indexing with embeddings
- Basic CLI search interface
- Simple metadata storage (SQLite)

**File Structure:**
```
memory_vault/
├── cli.py              # Commands: index, search, collect
├── collector.py        # Smart file collection and organization
├── indexer.py          # Document processing and embedding
├── searcher.py         # Semantic search and results
└── storage.py          # FAISS + SQLite management
```

### Phase 2: Collection Helpers (Week 2)

**Features:**
- Zip file extraction
- Duplicate detection
- Basic auto-organization
- Client folder management
- Progress indicators

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Researcher downloads interview batch from client drive
memory-vault collect ~/Downloads/interviews_oct_2024.zip --client "BankingApp"

Output:
> Extracting files...
> Found 12 interview transcripts
> Organizing into BankingApp/interviews/
> Detecting duplicates... none found
> Indexing new documents...
> ✓ Added 12 documents to Research Lake
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Search (Week 3)

**Features:**
- Cross-client pattern detection
- Time-based filtering
- Exclude archived projects
- Export search results
- Basic statistics

**Example Output:**
```bash
memory-vault search "users feeling overwhelmed"

Found across 3 clients:

[ClientA - MobileApp] interview_05.txt (92% match)
"It's just too much at once when you first open the app"

[ClientB - Ecommerce] usability_notes.md (85% match)  
"Participants felt overwhelmed by choice paradox on homepage"

[Internal] design_principles.doc (78% match)
"Progressive disclosure prevents overwhelming new users"

PATTERN DETECTED: "Overwhelm" theme appears in 6 projects over past year
RELATED CONCEPTS: "cognitive load", "information overload", "choice paralysis"
```

## Workflow Integration

### Daily Use Case

1. **Morning**: Designer needs to reference past research on accessibility
   ```bash
   memory-vault search "vision impairment" "screen reader"
   # Finds relevant research across 4 past projects
   ```

2. **Afternoon**: Researcher adds new interview batch
   ```bash
   memory-vault collect ~/Downloads/new_interviews.zip --client ProjectX
   # Automatically organized and indexed
   ```

3. **Weekly**: Team lead reviews patterns
   ```bash
   memory-vault stats --since "last week"
   # Shows new themes emerging across projects
   ```

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (MVP Launch)
- Index 500+ documents in < 2 minutes
- Search returns relevant results in < 1 second
- Find connections between 2+ unrelated projects
- Zero configuration required

### 30 Days
- Research Lake contains 5+ client projects
- Team finds at least 10 "forgotten insights"
- Search used daily by 3+ team members
- 50% reduction in "where was that research?" time

### 90 Days
- 1000+ documents indexed
- Pattern detection surfaces 5+ actionable insights
- Becomes primary research discovery tool
- Clear ROI from reused research

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Core MVP
- [x] Basic file indexing (txt, md)
- [x] FAISS semantic search
- [x] Simple CLI interface
- [x] Local storage only

### Week 2: Collection & Organization
- [ ] Collect command with unzip
- [ ] Auto-organization logic
- [ ] Duplicate detection
- [ ] Client folder structure

### Week 3: Search Enhancement
- [ ] Client filtering
- [ ] Time-based search
- [ ] Pattern detection
- [ ] Results export

### Week 4: Polish & Deploy
- [ ] Add remaining file types (docx, pdf)
- [ ] Progress indicators
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Large file handling**: Implement streaming for PDFs
- **Search quality**: Use same embeddings as Insight Synthesizer
- **Performance**: Add caching for repeated searches

### Adoption Risks
- **Habit change**: Make it 10x better than current search
- **Initial effort**: Collect command minimizes friction
- **Trust**: Show clear value in first use

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Team Sync**: Optional shared index via S3
2. **Smart Alerts**: "New research related to your query"
3. **Research Graph**: Visualize connections between projects
4. **Integration**: Auto-import from Insight Synthesizer
5. **Analytics**: Track what research gets reused

## Conclusion

Memory Vault MVP embraces the messy reality of distributed research files. By creating a simple "Research Lake" that grows organically, it provides immediate value while building toward a comprehensive knowledge management system. The semantic search capabilities will surface connections and insights that are currently lost in the chaos of multiple drives and folders.
